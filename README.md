# Project Overview

This project is a simple PHP application designed to redirect users from the root directory to the frontend section of the application. The main entry point is `index.php`, which handles the redirection by sending users to the `frontend/index.php` file.

## Installation

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Set up your web server**: Ensure you have a web server that can process PHP installed (e.g., Apache, Nginx). Make sure to point the web server's document root to this project's root directory.

4. **Start the server** (if necessary):
   For a PHP built-in server, you can run:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

## Usage

Simply open your web browser and navigate to the root URL of your application (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/`). The application will automatically redirect you to `frontend/index.php`, which is where the main frontend interface is located.

## Features

- **Simple Redirection**: The application uses a straightforward PHP script to redirect users to a specific frontend page.
- **Modular Structure**: The project is designed to separate the backend and frontend components, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

## Dependencies

Since the project is primarily a PHP script and does not include any additional libraries in `package.json`, there are no external dependencies. Ensure your server environment supports PHP.
